    "### Why Docstrings Matter (Especially for AI Agents!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Docstrings are **very important** in LangGraph. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For Human Developers**: Docstrings explain what your function does, making code maintainable\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For AI Agents** (coming in later notebooks): When you build AI agents with LLMs, they read docstrings to understand:\n",
    "   - What each tool/function does\n",
    "   - What parameters it accepts\n",
    "   - What it returns\n",
    "   - When to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: When we build an AI agent in Notebook 106, if you have:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def validate_address_object(state):\n",
    "    \\\"\\\"\\\"Validate SCM address object configuration.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Checks that address object name follows conventions and is ready for creation.\n",
    "    \\\"\\\"\\\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI agent reads this docstring and understands: \"This function validates address objects - I should use it when the user asks to validate a configuration before creating it!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the docstring, the AI agent doesn't know what your function does or when to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Your First Node\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a docstring: use three quotation marks `\\\"\\\"\\\"`\n",

    "**That's the whole flow!** Data entered the graph, flowed through the node which processed it, and came out updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Illustrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Flows Through**: The initial state enters at START and flows through each node\n",
    "2. **Partial Updates**: The node returns ONLY the fields it changes (just \"status\")\n",
    "3. **Automatic Merging**: LangGraph automatically merges the node's return value with the existing state\n",
    "4. **Immutability**: The original state isn't modified; a new merged state is created\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes This Powerful?\n",
    "\n",
    "The function logic could be anything! We chose a simple validation, but in production this would be:\n",
    "- ✅ An actual SCM API call to validate address object configuration\n",
    "- ✅ Checking address object type and value format (IP/netmask, FQDN, IP range)\n",
    "- ✅ Verifying folder/device group membership\n",
    "- ✅ Validating against naming conventions\n",
    "- ✅ Checking for duplicate names\n",
    "- ✅ Any other validation task you need!\n",

    "Congratulations! You've built your first LangGraph application! 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defined State** - Created `AddressObjectState` with TypedDict\n",
    "2. **Created Node** - Built `validate_address_object` function  \n",
    "3. **Built Graph** - Used StateGraph with add_node()\n",
    "4. **Compiled** - Created runnable application\n",
    "5. **Executed** - Invoked graph and saw data flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This pattern repeats everywhere in LangGraph:\n",
    "class MyState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    field: str\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_node(state: MyState) -> dict:\n",
    "    return {\"field\": \"updated\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "graph = StateGraph(MyState)\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"node_name\", my_node)\n",
    "graph.set_entry_point(\"node_name\")\n",
    "graph.set_finish_point(\"node_name\")\n",
    "app = graph.compile()\n",
